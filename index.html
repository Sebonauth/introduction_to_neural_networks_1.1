        <h3>The Rise of Neural Networks: From Perceptrons to Deep Learning</h3>
        
        <p>
            Picture yourself in 2012 at the world's most prestigious computer vision competition. Researchers from around the globe have gathered to see who has built the best system for recognizing objects in images. The tension is palpable as the results are announced. Suddenly, the room goes quiet. A team from Toronto has just blown away the competition, achieving an error rate almost half that of their nearest competitor.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Their secret? A neural network they called <strong>AlexNet</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This moment marked the beginning of a revolution in artificial intelligence. But to understand why it was so revolutionary, we need to go back in time. Way back.
